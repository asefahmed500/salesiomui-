## Core Functionality

### Commission Calculation Logic

Commissions are calculated based on two primary factors:

1. **Sale Amount**: The monetary value of the sale
2. **Target Completion**: The percentage of sales target achieved by the employee

The calculation formula is:
```
Commission = (Sale Amount √ó Commission Rate) √∑ 100
```

### Commission Rate Tiers

The system uses a tiered commission structure that rewards higher performance:

| Target Completion | Commission Rate |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Below 80%         | 0%              |
| 80% - 89%         | 1%              |
| 90% - 99%         | 2%              |
| 100% - 109%       | 3%              |
| 110% - 119%       | 4%              |
| 120% and above    | 5%              |

The system determines the applicable rate by finding the highest threshold that the actual target completion meets or exceeds.

### Custom Commission Rates

The system supports custom commission rates that can override the standard tier system:

- Individual sales records can have custom commission rates
- Useful for special promotions or exceptions
- Set via checkbox in the "Add Sales Record" form

## Components

1. **DashboardHeader**: Application header with "Edit Rates" button
2. **SummaryCards**: Displays key metrics (Total Sales, Total Commission, Average Commission)
3. **CommissionCalculator**: Interactive tool for calculating commissions
4. **SalesTable**: Table view of all sales records with sorting and filtering
5. **CommissionCharts**: Visualizations of commission data (pie chart and bar chart)
6. **CommissionRateEditor**: Modal for editing commission rate tiers
7. **AddSalesRecord**: Form for adding new sales records

## Data Models

### SalesRecord

```typescript
interface SalesRecord {
  employeeId: string
  employeeName: string
  designation: string
  productName: string
  saleAmount: number
  targetCompletion: number
  status: "Sold" | "Not Sold"
  customCommissionRate?: number
}
```

### CommissionRates

```typescript
